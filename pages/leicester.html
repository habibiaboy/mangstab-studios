<h4>About Leicester</h4>
<img src="img/icon-leicester.png" alt="">
<p>The club was re-elected to the Football League for the last time to date in 1915, when the League was suspended for four years due to a financial scandal and World War I. Leicester were playing in a regional league organised for Midlands clubs in this period. Due to financial problems, Leicester Fosse had ceased to exist when the League resumed in 1919. The club was reformed as Leicester City Football Club, particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status.</p>

<p>In 1925, the club were champions of Division Two under the management of Peter Hodge. Hodge's signings included Arthur Chandler, one of City's most famous players from this period, scoring a club record 273 goals between 1923 and 1935 and Adam Black, who has the club record for league appearances, 528. In 1929, the club recorded its highest ever finish in the Football League, finishing second to Sheffield Wednesday. The club's highest ever attendance was in 1928, 47,298 against Tottenham Hotspur into the FA Cup Fifth Round. The 1930s were less successful, with the club being relegated in 1935, although finishing first in Division Two in 1937, only to be relegated from Division One again in 1939. In 1939, the Football League was suspended due to the war, and just like in 1915â€“1919, City were forced along with other clubs to play in regional leagues.</p>
